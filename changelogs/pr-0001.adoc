# PR-0001

This PR provided the initial JenkinsX quick-start template for a library project
(i.e. a project that does only CI and deploys on to an artefacts repository [_Nexus_]).

To effectively validated that the PR does the feature above the following needs to happen:

. Generate a sample project with the *jx* command-line program (no need for the project to be imported into Jenkins X).
+
Execute:
+
```
jx create quickstart --dry-run --pack maven11 -g luminaraio
```
+
and follow the instruction of the project import wizard and select the project `luminaraio/library-quickstart`

. Validate that all instances of `ec-commons` are replaced by the name given to the project during step 1
. The project can *build successfully*
+
Execute:
+
```
mvn clean install
```
+
. (Optional) Import into _Jenkins X_ and validate a successful deployment to _Nexus_ happens
+
Execute:
+
```
cd <generated-project-name>
jx import --no-draft=true
```
+
